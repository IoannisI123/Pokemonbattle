Hello Everyone!

This is a Pokemon Battle Simulator built with HTML, CSS AND Javascript.
I built this mostly for fun in order to learn the basics of Javascript but as time went by I wanted to add more and more features.

You can see it live at: https://ioannisi123.github.io/Pokemonbattle/

Thank you for checking it out
